        <h2>Chapter 1: A little about Andrew Bach</h2>

        <p class="intro">My name is Andrew Bach. I am a 29 year old software developer for St.Joseph's Indian School. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss a little about 
            myself, my family, and my hobbies.</p>
        <p><span class="sentence">Born in Minnesota, I moved to South Dakota at the age of 6.</span> Here I met my wife in high school and 4 years later we welcomed our first of 
            four children. Now, we have two sons, Cale (6 years of age) and Keaton (2 Months of age), and two daughters, Anna (4 years of age) and Emery (2 years of age).</p>
        <p>Now on to a little about me. Being from Minnesota, hockey was naturally a favorite pass-time. I started playing at the age of 4 and have spent my entire life playing 
            and now coaching. Outside of hockey, I enjoy programming. I have enjoyed creating websites for myself and others as I have done freelance web development for over a 
            decade now, starting my junior year of high-school at the age of 17. I also create desktop applications in C# and once upon a time spent time making small games,
        tho my free time has dropped significantly having 4 children with my oldest 2 taking up time for hockey and soccer.</p>
        <p>Today, we live in the small town of Dell Rapids, where we are remodeling a 130 year old brick house. Dell Rapids has the benefit of being close enough to Sioux Falls, 
            South Dakota for the big town living, but far enough away to avoid some of the crime and issues common in a larger city. The Big Sioux river goes through town and has
             carved a chanel through the quartzite rock that Dell Rapids sites on. These channels are called dells and is where Dell Rapids got its name from. It is a beautiful
            town and we have enjoyed living here.</p>
